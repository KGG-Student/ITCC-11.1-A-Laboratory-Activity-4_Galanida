Features:
-3x3 Grid made with AWT Buttons.
-Two-player mode with alternating turns (X and O).
-Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals.
-Draw detection when the board is full and no winner.
-"New Game" button to reset the board and start over.
-Status display showing whose turn it is or who won.
